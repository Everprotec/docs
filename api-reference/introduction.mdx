description: 'Our API enables you to automatically generate links for our Age Verification Gateway to verify users from your website. In this documentation, you will find details on how to authenticate, create a verification session invitation link, and check the status of a verification session.'
---

## Getting Started

Every request you make to our API will need to be authenticated. To maximize security, your credentials are configured on a per site basis. Follow the authentication guide [here](/api-reference/authentication)

To generate your first verification session invitation link, you will need to have a site configured in the [dashboard](https://dashboard.everprotec.com/web). The _siteId_, which is required for invite requests, can be found in the url to the settings page for your site.

![dashboard.everprotec.com/web/settings/your_site_ID_here](/images/site-id.png)

View the [Create Invitation](/api-reference/endpoint/create-invite) endpoint documentation to test your first API request and learn how to integrate with our API in your project.
